# CoderspaceMealAppHomework

This app is using MVVM architectural design pattern. And developed for Codespace-Pazarama iOS bootcamp.
There is no Storyboard in the project. Everthing is created programatically in the project.
Also developed with the protocol oriented approach. Some datas are coming from mealdb api which
is free meal api. I used some crucial protocols in iOS development like Codable etc.If you have any question 
about this project dont hesitate to ask me from platforms like linkedin , mail etc. 

Resolution is not good because converting high resolution video to the gif :(
